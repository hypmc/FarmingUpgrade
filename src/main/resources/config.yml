# A list of harvesting tools and their properties.
# - Note that if an item has the unbreakable item attribute, it will never take any damage.
# - Damage determines how much damage a tool takes when harvesting one crop.
# - The radius is a decimal, but the final result from calculations is rounded down when used to find surrounding
#   blocks. 0 radius means that only the clicked block is found.
# - The first entry that applies to an item, is the one that is used to determine tool properties. If no entry applies
#   to an item, then the item is not a harvesting tool.
# - An entry may only apply to an item with the same material. If an entry has no material, then it may apply to an item
#   with any material.
# - An entry may only apply to an item which has the same lore as a substring somewhere in its item lore. If an entry
#   has no lore, then it may apply to an item with any lore.
# - The replant property can be true or false and determines if a tool replants. It is true by default.
# - The collect property can be true or false and determines if a tool collects. It is true by default.
