  # A list of harvesting tools and their filters and features.
  #
  # The first (ordered from top to bottom) tool with filters allowing an item, is the one that is used to determine the item's tool features. If no tool matches an item, then the item is not a harvesting tool.
  #
  # Tool filters:
  # - material: String/Material. The item must have this material. Remove to allow any material.
  # - lore: String. The item must have this string [as a substring, somewhere] in its lore. Remove to allow any lore.
  # - permission: String/Permission. The user must have this permission. Remove to allow any permissions.
  # - nbt: String. The item must have this FarmingUpgrade NBT-tag set to true. Remove to allow any NBT-tags.
  #   Example: If "nbt: golden", then the NBT-tag PublicBukkitValues/"farmingupgrade:golden" must be set to true (nonzero byte).
  #   Such an item can be created with the command [ /give @p minecraft:golden_hoe{PublicBukkitValues:{"farmingupgrade:golden":1b}} ].
  #
  # Tool features:
  # - radius: Decimal. Base tool radius. Total radius may be affected by other modifiers. The total radius is rounded down. 0 radius means that only the clicked block is affected.
  # - replant: Boolean. The tool replants a crop automatically after harvesting it.
  # - collect: Boolean. Any drops are collected immediately and placed in the inventory when using this tool.
  # - plant: Boolean. The plant property determines if a tool can plant seeds in the radius. Planting seeds do not damage the tool, only harvesting does.
  # - damage: Integer. Tool damage taken when harvesting a crop. Note that if an item has the attribute "Unbreakable" it will never take any damage.
