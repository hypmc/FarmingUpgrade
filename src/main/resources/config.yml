  # A list of harvesting tools, their harvest radiï and the damage they take from harvesting crops. Note that if an item
  # has the unbreakable item attribute, it will never take any damage.
  # The radius is a decimal, but is rounded down when used to find surrounding blocks.
  # The first entry that applies to an item, is the one that is used to determine radius and damage. If no entry applies
  # to an item, then the item is not a harvesting tool. An entry may only apply to an item with the same material. If an
  # entry has no material, then it may apply to an item with any material. An entry may only apply to an item which has
  # the same lore as a substring somewhere in its item lore. If an entry has no lore, then it may apply to an item with
  # any lore.
